## Description

This is the backend of a Social Media site. It uses MongoDB, express, and several other technologies to power the site.

** PLEASE NOTE ** After completing and submitting the assignment I discovered and patched an error in one of the routes. Access to the video showing the broken route can be accessed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hsR7hizjvo23OhEFVeGFKtTqpnvv7bJv/view).

The video showing the corrected route with all functionality properly working can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G7kxLP02B-aTVHtJUmDOmanHxUeoTieS/view).
